# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to my Customer Segmentation project! In this Jupyter Notebook, I dive into the Mall Customers dataset to explore and identify distinct customer groups based on their shopping patterns and personal demographics. This project aims to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to use clustering techniques to segment customers into groups based on similarities in their:
- Annual income
- Spending scores
- Age
- Gender

By understanding these segments, marketers can tailor their approaches to meet the specific needs and preferences of each group.

## Data Source
The data used in this project comes from the "Mall Customers" dataset available on Kaggle. It includes information like customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For all programming needs.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing K-means clustering.

## How to Run the Notebook
To run this notebook:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
